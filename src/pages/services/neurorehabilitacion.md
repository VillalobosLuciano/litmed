A common reaction to this approach is wondering, "isn't this just inline styles?" and in some ways it is — you're applying styles directly to elements instead of assigning them a class name and then styling that class.

But using utility classes has a few important advantages over inline styles:

**Designing with constraints**. Using inline styles, every value is a magic number. With utilities, you're choosing styles from a predefined [design system](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme), which makes it much easier to build visually consistent UIs.

**Responsive design**. You can't use media queries in inline styles, but you can use Tailwind's [responsive utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) to build fully responsive interfaces easily.

**Pseudo-classes**. Inline styles can't target states like hover or focus, but Tailwind's [pseudo-class variants](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/pseudo-class-variants) make it easy to style those states with utility classes.

This component is fully responsive and includes a button with hover styles, and is built entirely with utility classes:
